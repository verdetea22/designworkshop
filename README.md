Describe the problems:

a. What is the core problem each bot is trying to solve?

     The core problem our bot will solve is the financial complexities of the user and suggest effective financial practices. 
     
b. Why is it a problem worth solving?

     Everyone has to find a balance between their saving and spending, and most people can afford to have a greater sense of their financial standings and healthier financial habits.

Describe possible designs: 
a. What is the core product idea?

     The ultimate goal of our bot is to take various data inputs from the user about their spending habits and provide analytics on their periodic data, as well as serve helpful tips to aid in their savings. Our bot would also be able to track users' other assests and provide similar services -- all depending on how comfortable the users are with providing data. This service will be applicable and a great aid to those who use it, no matter the amount of data user wants to share. 
  
b. What are patterns that might be useful?

      The best bot pattern for this particular project would the be Responder. Its vital that the service knows the user and will retain the precious data that it is given, as well as being particularly interactive for the various number of actions users' will use.
  
c. Design sketches: Use wireframes, storyboards, and flow maps to describe your problem.

     Our design sketches have been added as a seperate entity within this repository.
